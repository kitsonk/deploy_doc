# docland

A Deno CLI/Deploy server application which generates documentation for arbitrary
JavaScript and TypeScript modules.

## Overview

When a documentation page is requested, the following occurs at a high level:

- The request URL is processed by the oak router, matching the URL to the route
  patterns.
- When it is matched to a documentation page, the middleware checks to see if
  the documentation JSON structure is in memory.
- If the module isn't in memory, the middleware will attempt to generate the
  documentation JSON structure.
- It calls the `doc()` function from [`deno_doc`](https://deno.land/x/deno_doc)
  with a custom in memory caching loader function.
- `doc()` uses [`deno_graph`](https://deno.land/x/deno_graph) and
  [swc](https://swc.rs/) to generate the documentation JSON structure.
- Once the structure is generated, it uses
  [Nano JSX](https://nanojsx.github.io/) and [twind](https://twind.dev/) to
  server side render a JSX/TSX structure which generates itself based off the
  JSON documentation structure.
- This is then passed back the the requestor.
- If the URL matched is a "card" image, this is server side rendered as a
  JSX/TSX SVG which is then rendered as a PNG using
  [resvg_wasm](https://deno.land/x/resvg_wasm).

## Starting

To run the server locally, execute the `main.ts`. If supported in your shell:

```
> ./main.ts
```

Or manually on the command line:

```
> deno run --config deno.jsonc --allow-read=. --allow-net --allow-env main.ts
```

The server will start listening on port `8080`, which will be logged to the
console when ready to accept requests.

If you are deploying on Deploy, the `main.ts` should be the module you deploy.

## Building

In order to speed up displaying the _built-in_ documentation, there is a build
script. This will fetch all the releases from GitHub for the Deno CLI and
rebuild the latest release, plus build any missing versions.

To execute the build script, and supported in your shell:

```
> ./build.ts
```

Or manually on the command line:

```
> deno run --config deno.jsonc --allow-read=. --allow-write --allow-net --allow-nev build.ts
```
